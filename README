fastcaptcha is another image captcha solution. It's simple and very fast.

INSTALL:
  
  sudo gem install fastcaptcha

REQUIREMENT:

  * Ruby >= 1.9.1
  * rubygems >= 1.3.5
  * ruby development libraries (debian: ruby1.9.1-dev)
  * opencv >= 2.1.0 development libraries

USAGE:

  >> require "rubygems"
  >> require "fastcaptcha"
  >> captcha = FastCaptcha.new
  # takes 2 args, memcache connection handle & complexity 1-4. 4 is for battling harcore spammers.
  >> captcha = FastCaptcha.new(@memcache_connection, 3)
  >> challenge = captcha.generate
  >> puts challenge.key
  >> puts challenge.image # PNG image data


SINATRA HELPER:

  * This adds a simple sinatra helper to display and validate captcha. Uses JQuery, so tough luck if you're
    using another Javascript library (patches welcome).

  Add the sinatra helper to your application:

  require 'sinatra/captcha'
  class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
    # ttl of captcha before user has to respond - 10s is an aggresive but reasonable value.
    set :captcha_ttl, 30
    # complexity 1 is simple, 4 is wicked hard (makes segmentation very difficult).
    set :captcha_level, 2
    register Sinatra::Captcha
  end

  Add the captcha to your form using the captcha helper:

  captcha(ajax: true, id: 'captcha_div')

  Validate the captcha on form submission:

  if captcha_correct?
    do_something
  else
    do_something_else
  end
